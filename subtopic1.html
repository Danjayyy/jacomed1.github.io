                Abstract: The way students learn today has evolved significantly, thanks to the dynamic interplay between Artificial Intelligence and remote/hybrid learning. This new learning landscape offers a fundamentally different approach from traditional education. Higher Education Institutions are increasingly using technology to cater to the needs of digital learners, reshaping the classroom experience. Technology in education offers several benefits, such as enhancing engagement and improving student success rates. One of the primary advantages of technology in education is easy access to information and resources. Students can use the vast power of the internet and digital tools to explore different subjects, conduct research, and access educational materials beyond traditional textbooks. Examples of this include digital libraries, online databases, and educational platforms. Digital libraries and databases provide students with many academic resources, including e-books, scholarly articles, journals, and multimedia content. Educational platforms and Learning Management Systems centralize educational resources, housing digital textbooks, multimedia content, interactive modules, and assignments. Moreover, Open Educational Resources present educational materials that are freely accessible, granting instructors and students access to textbooks, lesson plans, videos, and additional curriculum-aligned resources, which help to enhance the educational experience. This technological transformation not only adapts to the needs of modern learners but also paves the way for an enriched and more effective educational ecosystem.

                Abstract: Technology has revolutionized how people access and consume information. In the past, families gathered around radios and television sets for shared entertainment. However, one of the most significant changes in how news is consumed has occurred. I witnessed this changing landscape as a former TV and radio reporter from the 90s and 2000s. I started my career operating teleprompters and cameras but later transitioned to writing and reporting in a newsroom that had not yet embraced digital video. When I joined NBC Bay Area in 2006, many of the audience had already shifted to the Internet for their daily news, which significantly departed from traditional TV viewership. This trend has continued to gain momentum over the years, causing a decline in live TV audiences. This abstract highlights technology's far-reaching impact on news distribution and the evolving media landscape.
