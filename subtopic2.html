                Abstract: Raising children in the current era comes with a distinct set of obstacles primarily linked to the widespread use of technology. With technological advancements, it is undeniable that it has become an integral part of our daily lives. As a result, it has significantly impacted the lives of our children. There are many advantages and disadvantages when it comes to letting your child use Mobile devices, computers, and television as they grow up. Negative impacts can affect their ability to communicate with others, like in school, with their families, or when they grow up and have a career. Additionally, some impacts to their health can progress over the years, such as vision problems due to constant eye strain and lack of sleep due to losing track of time when on a device.

                Abstract: Extended exposure to screens can adversely affect eye health, causing conditions such as dry eye disease and myopia. The article shares the experiences of individuals who have encountered vision problems due to prolonged screen time, including dryness and irritation. Eye experts are concerned about the increase in irreversible eye disorders associated with extended screen use in adults and young individuals. According to a 2022 Statistics Canada survey, screen use has significantly increased during the pandemic. The article highlights the rise of myopia and meibomian gland atrophy (back sheath of the eye) due to inadequate blinking, leading to dry eyes during prolonged screen use. It emphasizes preventive measures such as limiting screen time, taking breaks, and following the 20/20/20 rule to protect eye health in this era of heightened digital screen usage.
